# Go Simple Authenthication 

This project is a simple command-line based user authentication system built with Go. It demonstrates a basic implementation of:

- Registration

- Login

- Forgot Password

- MD5 Password Hashing

The app stores user data in-memory (using a slice), and simulates real-world authentication logic like email checking and password verification using hashed values.
